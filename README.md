# Machine Learning 

This repo is the training codes of Associate Professor Şadi Evren ŞEKER's "Machine Learning with Python" course. 
In each folder, there is a separate dataset to run the codes of that section. 
This repo is a place where I go and review the topics that bother me, as it has introductory information on many topics about machine learning.
